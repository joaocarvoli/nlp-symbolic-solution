The Shawshank Redemption,cicixco,5.0,0,zh-tw,（有雷） 這部電影讓我感受到了真正的活著，大口呼吸著新鮮空氣的感受。劇情結構完整，伏筆也收得很好。雖說經歷了幾十年，但這部能成為經典感動世人也確實名副其實。 撇除劇情，表演非常傳神。囚犯、獄警之間的微妙關係很出彩，也將牢獄生態刻畫的很細膩。不再只是上課、自由活動放風等，而是透由啤酒、圖書館、一首歌，很貼切地表達出什麼叫做真正的「自由之感」。假釋出去不叫自由，唯有享受此時此刻，感受到真正的活著，才叫自由。電影主旨很大一部分都在探討這個核心問題，無論透由攝影、配樂、節奏⋯，都把這點抓的很緊，也難怪這部電影能如此深入人心。 美好的事物永不消逝，要心存希望的活著。電影中以Red娓娓道來的方式講述他看見的Andy（也正是如此，關鍵逃獄的伏筆收回時才能如此震撼），帶出Andy是如何救贖著Red，讓他在假釋出獄後沒有做出另一種選擇。那顆的攝影很有意思，先是從櫥窗櫃帶到裏頭一排排的槍枝商品，最後將視覺焦點對準在指南針上。片名也取得很棒，開頭在宣判Andy終身監禁後，帶出了Red假釋渴望下次次失敗，對未來心灰意冷的狀態。經歷了20、30、40年三次假釋的盤問，他最後一次的回應非常有意思，也再次應證了摩根費里曼的演技真的名不虛傳。也必須稱讚片尾關於red的選擇，不用直白的語言敘述，而是以一顆鏡頭、兩個物品（槍枝/指南針）帶出了他正在經歷的思考，andy過去和他許下去樹下找石頭的承諾在此時變得至關重要！ 雖說以五分來評，我可能落在4.6左右，很感人很溫暖，但好像有點太完美了。可是它讓我知道劇本寫得極好，故事核心極棒，那不需要什麼頂級特效或設計，它接回自己發光！很喜歡這部電影，希望我日後拍出的作品也如此溫暖人心～

The Shawshank Redemption,reeljenabeth,4.0,0,en,"The Shawshank Redemption—the ultimate prison escape movie. The setup is so clever, the dialogue is sharp, and watching the friendship between Morgan Freeman’s character and Tim Robbins’ Andy develop is one of the best parts. The ending somehow manages to be both heartbreaking and uplifting, which is a rare balance to strike. There’s a reason this movie is considered one of the greatest of all time."

The opening scene is extremely well edited, and very good choice by Frank Darabont to have the character development in jail then before he goes to jail. The struggle that Andy feels in jail I literally feel too. He spent 20 years in that place and when he escapes it…"

It's not just about surviving; it's about maintaining one's humanity in the face of dehumanizing circumstances. The film masterfully portrays how individuals can find strength in connection, in shared humanity, even within the most oppressive environment. The depiction of Shawshank itself is crucial. It's not merely a backdrop, but a character in its own right, a symbol…"
