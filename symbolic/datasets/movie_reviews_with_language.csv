2001: A Space Odyssey,palmgx,4.0,7,en,Gets better on rewatch. 2001 tells a compelling story about human vs technology & AI. The over reliance on technology that can lead to the downfall of humanity. It also explores a theme about how human’s intelligence can cause destructive things. I love how there’s tension between human and AI. I can definitely see the influence this movie has on movies like Terminator and Alien. But 2001 did it first. The first 20 minutes opening was genius stuff. I love how…

2001: A Space Odyssey,juanferrer,5.0,0,en,"A cinematic masterpiece that continues to redefine the science fiction genre. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the vastness of space with incredible precision. The editing is seamless, propelling the story forward while allowing for moments of quiet reflection. Kubrick’s direction is visionary, and the way it explores the profound themes of evolution, artificial intelligence, and humanity's place in the cosmos. The performances, particularly from Keir Dullea and the iconic HAL 9000, are perfectly suited to the film's cold, cerebral tone. Its innovation to cinema, both technically and thematically, is unmatched. One of my all-time favorite films that's a timeless exploration of the unknown."

INSANE visuals and special effects but my god do some scenes go on interminably. Score is maybe one of the best of all time but the pacing and the complete lack of emotion just ruin it for me. Throw in my general dislike for Kubrick and it’s all so not my thing even though I’ll admit it’s well-crafted, and I love so many films inspired by it. But alas :("
2001: A Space Odyssey,thewatcherjoe,3.0,1,en,An achievement of its time no doubt. I'm sure if I had watched it when it originally released that I would be dazzled by every frame. Unfortunately I am in the camp of this movie is way too long. I also never really cared about any of the characters. Maybe I've seen too much modern sci-fi for this to hit. I'm glad I watched it but I never want to see it again.

A few thing throw you off like the CGI feeling a little too fake & the intro was unnecessarily extremely long. Considering this was from 60 years ago it’s understandable and still very impressive. Not much happens & the story is pretty slow. A lot of parts of this movie felt very stretched. However I found the movie pretty entertaining 40 minutes in. Also I don’t mean to nitpick but there was this weird long black screen in the start and in the middle while watching which was slightly weird.

Interesting that this was his follow up to Dr. Strange Love, still dealing with mankind, and human nature, but personifying it into HAL, and thus creating the A.I. goes rogue narrative.

2001: A Space Odyssey,pina_joao,4.5,0,pt,Visualmente impecável. Muitos filmes de cgi atuais não alcançam as maravilhas desse filme. Arte pura. Meia estrela a menos por querer mais diálogos.
2001: A Space Odyssey,blackedout,5.0,3,en,"I think to truly understand this movie I would need to watch this multiple times. I think just production and filmmaking alone this is spectacular. The sound work and music in general is bombastic and is a huge highlight of the movie. The effects are incredible for 1968, not even in a of its time way but for its timeless futuristic style, along with the spaces designs and details into it. I love the character of Hal 9000 and the…"

2001: A Space Odyssey,darcne_,3.0,1,ar,مبدئياً اقل من التوقعات بشكل كبير، فلم فيه مميزات وسلبيات اكثر. اولاً السلبيات: الاحداث بطيئة جداً و القرود الي ف البدايه مدري ايش يبي فيها خذت وقت وكان يقدر يوصل الفكره؛ نظرية داروين، في ٥د بس و اول ٤٠د جداً بطيئه وسيئة و خلتني اسحب ع الفلم وأكمله اليوم الثاني. ثانياً المميزات او الإيجابيات: الأصوات تااريخية و سالفة ان الصوت يختفي في مشاهد الفضاء شي رهيب و التصوير الكواكب والمركبات رهيبه ع ذاك الوقت. صح كان جيد بس اي شخص يقارنه بإنتيرستيلار مايفهم.
